Included in this directory are a number of skeletal code fragments, which you
can fill out to solve various synchronization problems. Check them out!

And see Allen Downey's book, [q A Little Book of Semaphores], for even more
fun. It's also free!

To compile any one of them (say, one called "foo.c"):

prompt> gcc -o foo foo.c -Wall -pthread

And then, to run it:

prompt> ./foo

(maybe with some optional arguments)
